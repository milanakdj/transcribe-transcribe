WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
At the store, we sell Nepali products like hemp bags, mufas, etc.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
During festivals?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, during festivals.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We sell everything.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And they finish everything in Christmas.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We don't sell everything, but we finish everything in Christmas.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We go to the market to see what products we can sell.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We still have room for discussion.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We have a list of our own.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We share this exercise with them.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And we discuss what we can do to improve the exercise.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We have a long paper and we are supposed to buy it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I didn't know that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, moving forward to the youth program.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For the youth program, we have a youth support class.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We have two initial conversations with the teachers and the school.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I wasn't a part of the youth program.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But does our youth student have the right to improve?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What do you think?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What did you think?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If students look at us as if we were working part time...

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
No, we are not working part time.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But we are not complying at all.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All the names of the students and their phone numbers are in the statement.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And then they show our presence through messages.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
For example, they send us messages on Facebook.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They send us style messages.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And then they ask us to send them a message.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then they can see our presence.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They will feel that it's not that we are lost.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We don't need to go that far.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If there is an organization, such as ISHI,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we will give them all these information.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We will give some presentations...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We will do that.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We need your end of March energy.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We must do it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's do it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's talk about it in Nepalese.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We must do this again for sure.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Don't feel wrong.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Because you know,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
SCU has been mobilizing.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I am sure.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So before March,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we are going to do this again again again.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You can do it yourself.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Some Twitter questions?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Social Week outcome.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Means the scholarships.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In Social Week,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we finished the third quarter

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and now we are starting

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
our last quarter starting today.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And besides that,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
our health workshop

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
was conducted on 16th January

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
along with

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
distribution of Hygiene Pack.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And after that,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
our Amics Nepal

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Logo Printed Merch.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
so now

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we are planning

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
this Social Week

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Guest Lectures and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Pill Visits

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
will be planned

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
as tentative

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
as possible.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And besides that,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
our 25th to 26th

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
entire

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
curriculum

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and framework

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
will be drafted.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And in Social Hours,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
they are all in their

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
respective,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
not all,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
they will be in their

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
respective placements.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And in their 17th January,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
we had a workshop

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and they were also

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
distributed Hygiene Pack

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
along with EN's Logo Printed Merch.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in this Social Hours,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
three people will have to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
look for internship placements.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Alisha and Son will have to look for

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
internship placements.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And Sonu will have to look for

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
fashion designing classes.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
For those who have watched the previous

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
video, it has been said that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
they don't understand the meaning of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Roppa because

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
they only do simple designs

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and there is only one slot

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
left for morning shift.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So we are planning to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
search for that one.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I think

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
we can

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
proceed going further.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
They don't know basic stitching.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So if they see something for

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
design, basic design,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
you cannot talk to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
all these

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
design and whatever thing.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I think Isha will also have to say something.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I have already said

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
she was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
exacting

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It is a free

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
course for women only.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And she just had to say

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.000


00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
of course.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Isha is

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
like

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
someone who

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
is not alive.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Because fashion designing

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
is very expensive.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It is a course for 8 months.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It was around

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
1 lakh something.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And that comes down to

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
very expensive.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And I told her if you are getting a free course

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
along with the sewing kit,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
don't take the sewing kit.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You keep that.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And then

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
she started saying

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
it is just basic designs.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Plus class timings

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
don't match.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I told her it is fine.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
If you want to adjust the timings.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
She said no.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And then

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I told her not to make any further argument.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We can still go.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
At least to get in touch

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
with this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
organization.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Just to understand

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and show our experience.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
She said

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
phone was having

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
a hard time.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Though that is completely stupid at all.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I cannot afford

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to lie.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I don't want to do it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I don't want to do that.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It is stupid.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
If she can't do it,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
why is she

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
under the beneficiary of

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Angshar Nepal.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Though that is stupid.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I think

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it would be more

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
valid thing

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
if we can go from

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
our direction.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
No money.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
In fact, I know

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
in our women's home,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
how many women are there in tailoring?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Four.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Four women are tailoring.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We are paying for them.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
The sewing machines and everything.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They would get it for free.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We can initiate

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
by showing our presence.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Even if our youth

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
doesn't come,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
we can still send our women.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
We get free

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
from those four women.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Those four would

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
send their daughters.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It is still one possibility.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I think we should go from that perspective.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Have you visited Jogpath?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Last time we visited.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I brought her number

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
from Asthi.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
The new session

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
started from Asthi.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Today is 3rd day of 4th day.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
From 10.45pm

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
to 11.00pm

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
because one man is there

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
to take the interview.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There would be certain criteria.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
They have to come from

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
unprivileged family background

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
who cannot really afford.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Few questions

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
would be asked.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We can go today

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and ask these people.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I don't know

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
if there is one possibility.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Do they have

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
a shop where women

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
can sell

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
all these things?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
No.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
They don't have a physical store.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I think what can we do?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
For our youth,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
what if we can try

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to organize a field visit?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Jogpath is

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
its own organization.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Their stores are

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
very small.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Field visit,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
we can do that.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We will take the youth

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and see what they can do.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What kind of field visit

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
can we do?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
For example,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I will assume,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
they will do a short presentation

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
not on this topic.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
They can do it in the store

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
or factory.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It is not possible.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
They do a short presentation

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
about how they

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
are sustaining.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
What are their needs?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
What are their main motives?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We can organize

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
a field visit.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We can organize

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
a field visit.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
more of that, more of that, and then having to, I don't know if they would allow, but

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
then if allowed, to communicate with this woman, to take out maybe a few of their bibles,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I don't know if that is possible.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We have our own organization.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Last time we went to make these paper bags, but they didn't make the paper bags.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was only stitching.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And even though they have their own organization, they were not that interested.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So we, the facilitator, he had brought a number, so there is a possibility of bringing him here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He can visit the field, but I don't think he will accept the presentation.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But he can bring his facilitator here and do it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
She said she was free on Thursday, Friday, something like that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So he can bring her here on that day, and he can propose to her that he is interested

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in the Moroo field visit.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Last time we were there in the town.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Roshan?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Yes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So he can buy from outside and bring her here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We have our own organization.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Yes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But his products are very good.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The bags.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Yes.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I told you, it was a very good opportunity for Sonu.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If she really wants to do it, then we can do it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Or maybe, if she really wants to do it, there might be this possibility of collaborating

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
with them, polish stitching, and we show you.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We give them this offer.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We show you the t-shirts.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You buy the bags.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We are going to take every year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Every year, we meet this.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
One garment, maybe 50 of that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I don't know.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Let's see.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Maybe not.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
One garment, maybe 20 pieces.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So that is still going to be benefited.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Who knows, we are willing to do this.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We are also trying to give them business.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We know that this money is going to something sustainable.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's not going to a very commercialized industry.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It is going to an industry which is very sustainable, which is working for the environment.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
For the community.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Maybe, there can be this room.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Let's try to see.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We can collaborate in a lot of ways.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They are an organization.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Can you give me this link?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I will just study it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I am so busy with my schedule.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Because the narrative has come.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now, I have to do the narrative.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And now, the content of the magazine.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I have shared it with you.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We can see this.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We can try.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
One photo with you.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
For the time being, let's try to do both of these options.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Again, Raju.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Ram Bahadur Moghul.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Thank you so much.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Moving forward.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We have a lot of payment bills.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
We have to pay them.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We have to pay for the cross-check.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And for the office record.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We have to pay.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
PBL 6 and 7.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Our final event.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
In January.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
In December.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We had a meeting in January.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
29th.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
6th and 23rd.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
This is back to back.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I'm sure they're going to ask.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's also for us.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
December.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
December.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Why?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Of course, they're not going to say why.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's better for us to explain.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It would be better to give them a valid reason.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Event.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Event.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Event.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It is going to somehow.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Miscommunication.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Mismanagement.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Instead, it is.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Wiser.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
To give them a context.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Regarding.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
No.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Even.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
The art.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And solidarity.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We are afraid.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
That children will not be able to.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It will happen.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It will happen.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It will happen.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It will happen.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It will happen.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Cheremos.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.000


00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Chambers.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Chambers.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
audience.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
The

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
organization.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
The

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
organization.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
organization.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Do your own

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
name of the

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
school.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Language

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
school.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Okay.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Okay.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Okay.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Okay.

WEBVTT

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So that's all from the children's program.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So children's homes...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Just to let you know, I don't know if it has been communicated to you, right?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Yes, it has been communicated to us.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So we are very happy to have you here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Thank you.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thank you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Thank you.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Thank you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Thank you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Thank you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Thank you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Thank you.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Thank you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Thank you.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Thank you.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Thank you.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Thank you.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It has been communicated.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But for experiential learning, we are doing a mid-event.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So there is a mid-event happening in a few days.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For the mid-event, we were discussing what we would do for Phase 8.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But we had not planned it, so I had not watched it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It was in the calendar.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, we are going to have a class discussion.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We will discuss how to define women, how to create art.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
For the mid-event, we will all sit together and discuss.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:51.000
.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:17.000
.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Let me talk about it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:43.000
.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
For the CH event, we are planning to reschedule it for February.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:05.000
.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
In the cold season, it does not have to be February.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It can be in March, but I do not want to go.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
For me, it is either in the rainy season.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
In the rainy season, it is difficult to make it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It is cold and the weather is nice.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
In the summer, it is so cold.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We will not be able to do it.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We will not be able to do it in the right time.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The board is asking me to break down the expenses.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I can say it happens. One event is for Spiti to take lead. One event will be for Proximity to take lead. One event will be for Julian to take lead.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And one event, Rozen can take lead.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And you can have your own person that will support you. Maybe in your case it can be Sandvich.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In your case it can be, I don't know.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And also there is Uyebani. It can be Asu. Asu wants to go. Mike wants to go too.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we can divide them. Though we know that we are taking a few youths to Manang.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Yes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I was going to say that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We are taking a few youths.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We are taking a few youths from the program to Manang.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There is a program called B90.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It is a new event.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It is a new event for me.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It is an old event.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How many youths are we taking?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't know. We have to check out the budget.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Okay.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But anyway, let me do it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Let's insist on two.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then we can think of where we are taking them.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I have sent you the plans for Birak Nagar by road and by plane.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It is a decision made in 2000-3000.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Exactly. We are also talking about it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If it is done by car, it is going to take us 2000.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Not going, but 2000 in a good car.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If it is done by car, it is going to take us 2000.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If it is done by road, it is going to take us 1000.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If it is done by car, it is going to take us 1000.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If it is done by flight, it is going to take us 1000.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It is going to be somewhere around 35,000.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
While the plane is 5000.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I saw that it is going to be 4000-3000.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
James, I told you to book a little earlier.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you book a little earlier, it is going to be cheaper.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But even if you do three at a time, it is going to be cheaper.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So, if you do it a little earlier, it is going to be cheaper.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yeah, in that sense, it won't be so expensive.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
For it, it is going to be 2000.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But it is going to be 20 euros.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Right?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Because that is what they were saying.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
20 euros.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Yes.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
20 euros.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It is going to be 20 euros.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So, they were meaning to do it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I am going to share the rest of the items with you.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I am going to add more.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I am going to add the end page.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I am going to add the rest of the links.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Okay.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, as we are doing that.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It is the end of the meeting.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Are you leaving?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yes.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yes, I am leaving.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You can meet me again.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
No, I am leaving.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It is a public meeting.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It is a public meeting.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
No, I am leaving.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
No, I am leaving.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
No, I am leaving.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Yes, I am leaving.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Okay.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
All right.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay.

Okay.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Goodbye.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I will be leaving now.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Goodbye.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I will be leaving now.

Thanks for watching.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.500
I will talk even more in the future.

We're not supposed to pay that.

We're not supposed to pay that.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:41.320
We're not supposed to pay that. six.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:22.320
the

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320
is only 23, which one that is

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.399
is only 23, which one that is

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:33.340
is only 23, which one that is saying that they are

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.340
but it is not

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:37.419
but it is not

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.919
but it is not enough that they

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:38.979
enough that they

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:48.619
they have to make a

00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:50.479
Before we discuss in the

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:50.960
So, Daniel wants me to write

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.020
So, Daniel wants me to write

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.099
Yeah.

00:08:55.099 --> 00:09:01.840
when we text them to do

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.500
That's it in detail.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.359
So, I have to write this

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:18.539
is easy to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In November and December was the final event. Was it in Jan?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Because when I checked the calendar, it was in mid-Jan.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And we were supposed to get married in Jan, not in December.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And we got married at the end of mid-Jan.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It was supposed to be in Jan.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It was supposed to be in December.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But we were supposed to get married in October.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I was a bit anxious.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But it was supposed to be in October.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But it was supposed to be in December.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In the new strategy, you mentioned the field visit and the template of the guest speakers.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Can you tell us about that?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You mentioned the template of the guest speakers for the internal report.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What about the template of the new strategy?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I am trying to make a checklist for every calendar.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We have tried a little bit in the copy and paste.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In the copy and paste, there is a master sheet.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If we see which events took place, what is the data,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
everything is described in the master sheet.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You can see the field visit, the final event, and the content.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Once you look into it, you will know which events took place.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You can also see which events are yet to take place.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We have only seen the events that have already taken place.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
What about the curriculum, development, and classes implementation?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We are supposed to share our plan and framework.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It is already activated for 2025.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In this, we have compiled the guest speakers' field visits and the final event workshops.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We are planning to share this with our registered clients.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I want you to share the documents so that you can be in the account all the time.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I want us to see the overview.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You have to be answerable to your staff.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We are being lenient in the sense that we are meeting with our staff.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Just have a go and talk to them.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
As CP said, we will be working on the English curriculum from today.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
There are no updates in collaboration and intern.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
For the staff, the children program coordinator and youth program coordinator

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
have already shared the operational sheet with us.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Operational sheet?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I am not sure.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I am not sure.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I saw the sheet and I saw that there is no date.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I saw that and I saw that there is no date.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I also have to take a timeline.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I have to take a timeline for the operational and other logistics.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Okay.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
After this, we will update the accounting and auditing.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Finance book.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I think I have to wait.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
CP done.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
CP done.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
CP done.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Okay.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000
CP done.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
CP done.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
CP done.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Okay.

Okay.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Okay.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I don't have a fixed place to work right now, so I'm like moving in and yeah, I mean,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm not expecting a high-end high-speed computer, it's just a basic computer.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So, regarding admin, I think Ana Martinez is available for volunteer for 2-3-1.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So Patricia is actually the one who is managing it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So, all the volunteers from this side.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, if in case, just to let you know, I want to volunteer.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We'll have that very random walk-in for foreigners.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, once in a blue moon, I think.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And if they would say, I want to volunteer, give you a procedure, I'm not going to lie.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They might come to you, you know.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Patricia is actually the one.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Patricia is a volunteer from our website.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I think each volunteer needs to pay a certain amount to volunteer.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:24.000
June 16th, I think, June 16th, we'll cover health insurance during that time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You should always ask if there is any volunteer.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
If there is a volunteer who just randomly walks in, I mean, wants to volunteer, then you should direct them to go to the website.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And you will check the section called volunteer.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And there you are supposed to send your CV, cover letter to Patricia, and Patricia will review that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Of course, you can give them a call, you know.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
If all of the folks in UEFA ask to generate money to get on it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Because sometimes, they just randomly want to walk in, and they just randomly want to give money.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That also happens.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They just randomly want to walk in.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And we expect them to do the same program.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And then they...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
They can plan the projects.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, for the more aligned logic, they are...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
They can plan the projects.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And then you have to prepare for the fundraising, donor registration, and reporting.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So, I have updated all the activity lists.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And the monthly revisions we shared that have to be filled.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So, I'll be working on that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And I'll be covering some of the other activities as well.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Just so that you know.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
By 25th of January, which is this Friday.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't know how possible it is.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Because today is already Tuesday.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You see the resolution, but it's hard.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Anyway, I'm trying my best to pull it off.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Of course, I'll also get back to...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Hello, hello?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Hello.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Hello.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Hi.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Hello.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Yes.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Yes.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
My name is...

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
My name is...

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
My name is Rajesh.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's been a while since I've seen you.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Yes.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
My name is...

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
My name is Rajesh.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It's been a while since I've seen you.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Yes.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It's been a while since I've seen you.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yes.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And I just want to say that I am...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That I am a millionaire.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
My point is...

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
What I feel is that the exchange of...

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I feel is that the exchange of...

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I feel is that the exchange of...

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So, I would...

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.000
So, we have strictly told CPQA students.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.979
We are not providing them an earphones, either.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Last year.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It's been 6 years.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We ask that they stop asking for basic things way beyond what they need

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So, we have stopped giving them basic things.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
If they need to ask for earphones, we do a research and

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we check in 3 places.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I, Rohit, Rujanji, Alisha, Navidehi, Sonbish, Time.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We cross-check and decide if it is okay to give them or not.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
That's what we are doing right now.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And I will not tell you about external communication.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
In this, we...

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
In External Communication, first we do...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We keep mailing AZM mails to sign up,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and the emails that we would like would have been stopped before.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In this, we also divide up work.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We have divided up every person's review,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And anyone's plans,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And even reviewing EC for any program,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
we have already solved all of this in Canvas.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So, for any internal reports,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Rohitji will share these templates.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So, is that fine?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So, once the report is collected,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I will create it.

WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's start doing that more.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.439
Because, I told you, you know,

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:48.740
what Russell Mishelman said,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.580
he was, you know,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.959
what are the programs that they can develop?

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:53.200
Excellent, no?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, that's all for today's meeting.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yeah, I mean, just to add to one of the parts of the presentation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I want to create a chart,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't know, make a chart,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I don't know, make a chart,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
make it in Illustrator or whatever.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So, what I want to do is,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Early calendar, sir.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Early calendar, no?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'll tell you.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Oops.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Excuse me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, let's try to paste it here in this way,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
because we are using this way.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Okay.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Very old.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Paper.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Calendar.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
What was it?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And it based on your plan.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I mean,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.000
we are planning to create one video.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I mean,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I don't know if we are using it anymore.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Email thread.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Okay.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Okay.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
if you say that,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:16.000
If you are coming for 15 days,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Let's assume,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
If you are coming for 15 days,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You can pay 1500.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Right?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Or let's say,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
If you are coming only for 10 days,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Let's pay 1000.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Right?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So, if you are coming for 15 days,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Pay 1500.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But if you are coming for 11 days,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Pay 2000.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
If you are coming for 16 days,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Pay 2000.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Okay?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Okay.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Okay.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Let's do.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Okay.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Okay.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Okay.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Okay.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Okay.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Okay.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
But make sure you are not using it for that, for until 3 months.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We say that 3 months is too long.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here in Bajaj, everyone is using WhatsApp.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you are using it for 3 months, then it's okay.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, you can use it every month, but you keep it in a safe place.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in 3 months, you can use it for other apps.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For example, you can use it for 30 houses.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can use it for other apps.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And until then, you are using it for 30 apps.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Or if you want to deposit it in your account, you can use it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can use it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you want to deposit it, you can use it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here, you can deposit it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Or you can keep it in a safe place.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can keep it in a safe place.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You can always use it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you are in a bank, it is okay to keep it in a safe place.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, keep it in a safe place.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And don't show it to anyone.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You can even keep it in a safe place.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you want to keep it, you can use it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You can keep it in a safe place.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, keep it in a safe place.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And don't show it to anyone.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Keep it in a safe place.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Keep it in a safe place.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Do you want to say anything to anyone?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Is there anything else?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I was so pissed off with one Sam Thani guy.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
He had a very long training.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And every day he used to send me a message.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It was not as a joke.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But he said he was frustrated with me.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And I gave him the card.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And he did a small thing for me.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
He used to do this and that.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I used to call him.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I used to call him with my phone.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And I used to call him with my phone.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And he did it instantly.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
No, it's so frustrating.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's not like that with women.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They don't let their wives talk to them.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And sometimes they don't talk to me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Of course, I was frustrated.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Sometimes, he was not willing to talk to me.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I was also like that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So yeah, no, I do think about it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Yeah, I mean, imagine how many family members do you have?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Pardon?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
How many family members do you have?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Five.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
If you don't want to say.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
No, no, I'm fine.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So five people, how much do you spend in a month?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I don't know, I'm so sorry.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Because we have paid them 15 rupees.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
15 rupees we have paid them.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It's a little bit too much.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Yeah.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So I mean, it's a little bit too much.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's a little bit too much.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's a little bit too much.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I don't know why it's a little bit too much.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yeah.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And then we have found literally, literally we have found them making us leave.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Yeah.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Yeah.

Yeah.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Yeah.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Yeah.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yeah.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Yeah.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Yeah.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yeah.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
No.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
No.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
No.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
No.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
No.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
No.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
No.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
No.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
No.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
No.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
No.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
No.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
No.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
No.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
No.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
No.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
No.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
No.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
No.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
No.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
No.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
No.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
No.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
No.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
No.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
No.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Sorry.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Be cautious.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Be cautious.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I don't mean like do not trust them.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Be cautious of their actions around you.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That would be the message.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Especially the chicken momos.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I don't remember why they were giving me chicken.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It came in a big size.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It was not distributed to me one by one.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I can talk to them about this.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It should come under my review.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
It should come under my review.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Thank you for watching.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
You cannot lure the customer with the art of coloring

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.800
Instead, it is a scheduled activity

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
A kind of method to engage people

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.480
Oh! there's that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
Toria

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.559
That's exactly what we were about to say

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.620
Even the editorial team will start discussing

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.639
Because it is needed

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.799
The way the editor just posted that

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.139
I was about to give that

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.760
How did it become that?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.320
I'll explain

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.340
I was going to throw that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.780
Now our idea of collapsing the water

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.900
Our C Weg fans

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.139
There's still some momo left

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.900
We were supposed to eat momo

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.380
She said there's still some momo left

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.099
There's no momo left

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.299
She said there's no momo left

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.020
And sent me home

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.340
Then she was going to eat the momo

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
We were hiding the plastic underneath

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
And we were like

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Okay, fine, let's eat it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.060
But at least in a form

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.220
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.660
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.820
But at least we say we don't want to eat it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.259
But we don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.459
Then we keep it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.060
Suji Bishan

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.299
Yeah

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.660
But then we'll think about it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.660
So maybe like

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.459
Maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow and put it there

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.059
We don't even have a fucking problem

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:30.660
No, but the thing is to inform them

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.260
Yeah, but what I'm saying is like

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
It is a good conversation

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.660
And I would know that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
I think that's a good thing

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.660
No, no, no, no

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660
It's like you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
You know

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
But I mean also

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
You know, like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
They have a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660
They have a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
They have a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
They have a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.660
They have a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.660
They have a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.660
They have a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.660
They have a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.660
They have a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.660
They have a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
They have a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
They have a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
You should see

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.660
Right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
In that sense

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
They'll put way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:26.520
notice

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.300
you

It's like you

Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

You should see

Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:26.520
notice

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.300
you

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
You cannot lure the customer with the art of coloring

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.800
Instead, it is a scheduled activity

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
A kind of method to engage people

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.480
Oh! there's that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
Toria

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.559
That's exactly what we were about to say

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.620
Even the editorial team will start discussing

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.639
Because it is needed

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.799
The way the editor just posted that

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.139
I was about to give that

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.760
How did it become that?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.320
I'll explain

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.340
I was going to throw that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.780
Now our idea of collapsing the water

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.900
Our C Weg fans

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.139
There's still some momo left

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.900
We were supposed to eat momo

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.380
She said there's still some momo left

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.099
There's no momo left

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.299
She said there's no momo left

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.020
And sent me home

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.340
Then she was going to eat the momo

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
We were hiding the plastic underneath

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
And we were like

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Okay, fine, let's eat it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.060
But at least in a form

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.220
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.660
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.820
But at least we say we don't want to eat it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.259
But we don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.459
Then we keep it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.060
Suji Bishan

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.299
Yeah

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.660
But then we'll think about it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.660
So maybe like

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.459
Maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow and put it there

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.059
We don't even have a fucking problem

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:30.660
No, but the thing is to inform them

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.260
Yeah, but what I'm saying is like

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
It is a good conversation

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.660
And I would know that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
I think that's a good thing

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.660
No, no, no, no

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660
It's like you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
You know

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
But I mean also

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
You know, like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
They have a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660
They have a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
They have a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
They have a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.660
They have a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.660
They have a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.660
They have a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.660
They have a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.660
They have a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.660
They have a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
They have a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
They have a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
You should see

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.660
Right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
In that sense

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
They'll put way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:26.520
notice

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.300
you

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
You cannot lure the customer with the art of coloring

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.800
Instead, it is a scheduled activity

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
A kind of method to engage people

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.480
Oh! there's that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
Toria

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.559
That's exactly what we were about to say

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.620
Even the editorial team will start discussing

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.639
Because it is needed

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.799
The way the editor just posted that

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.139
I was about to give that

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.760
How did it become that?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.320
I'll explain

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.340
I was going to throw that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.780
Now our idea of collapsing the water

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.900
Our C Weg fans

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.139
There's still some momo left

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.900
We were supposed to eat momo

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.380
She said there's still some momo left

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.099
There's no momo left

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.299
She said there's no momo left

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.020
And sent me home

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.340
Then she was going to eat the momo

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
We were hiding the plastic underneath

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
And we were like

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Okay, fine, let's eat it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.060
But at least in a form

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.220
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.660
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.820
But at least we say we don't want to eat it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.259
But we don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.459
Then we keep it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.060
Suji Bishan

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.299
Yeah

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.660
But then we'll think about it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.660
So maybe like

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.459
Maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow and put it there

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.059
We don't even have a fucking problem

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:30.660
No, but the thing is to inform them

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.260
Yeah, but what I'm saying is like

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
It is a good conversation

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.660
And I would know that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
I think that's a good thing

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.660
No, no, no, no

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660
It's like you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
You know

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
But I mean also

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
You know, like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
They have a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660
They have a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
They have a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
They have a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.660
They have a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.660
They have a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.660
They have a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.660
They have a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.660
They have a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.660
They have a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
They have a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
They have a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
You should see

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.660
Right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
In that sense

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
They'll put way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

You should see

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.660
Right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
In that sense

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
They'll put way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:26.520
notice

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.300
you

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
You cannot lure the customer with the art of coloring

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.800
Instead, it is a scheduled activity

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
A kind of method to engage people

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.480
Oh! there's that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
Toria

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.559
That's exactly what we were about to say

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.620
Even the editorial team will start discussing

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.639
Because it is needed

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.799
The way the editor just posted that

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.139
I was about to give that

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.760
How did it become that?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.320
I'll explain

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.340
I was going to throw that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.780
Now our idea of collapsing the water

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.900
Our C Weg fans

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.139
There's still some momo left

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.900
We were supposed to eat momo

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.380
She said there's still some momo left

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.099
There's no momo left

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.299
She said there's no momo left

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.020
And sent me home

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.340
Then she was going to eat the momo

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
We were hiding the plastic underneath

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
And we were like

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Okay, fine, let's eat it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.060
But at least in a form

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.220
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.660
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.820
But at least we say we don't want to eat it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.259
But we don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.459
Then we keep it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.060
Suji Bishan

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.299
Yeah

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.660
But then we'll think about it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.660
So maybe like

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.459
Maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow and put it there

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.059
We don't even have a fucking problem

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:30.660
No, but the thing is to inform them

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.260
Yeah, but what I'm saying is like

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
It is a good conversation

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.660
And I would know that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
I think that's a good thing

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.660
No, no, no, no

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660
It's like you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
You know

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
But I mean also

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
You know, like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
They have a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660
They have a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
They have a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
They have a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.660
They have a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.660
They have a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.660
They have a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.660
They have a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.660
They have a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.660
They have a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
They have a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
They have a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
You should see

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
You should see

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.660
Right

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
In that sense

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.660
They'll put way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:26.520
notice

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.300
you

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
You cannot lure the customer with the art of coloring

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.800
Instead, it is a scheduled activity

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400
A kind of method to engage people

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.480
Oh! there's that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.980
Toria

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.559
That's exactly what we were about to say

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.620
Even the editorial team will start discussing

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.639
Because it is needed

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:22.799
The way the editor just posted that

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.139
I was about to give that

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.760
How did it become that?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.320
I'll explain

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.340
I was going to throw that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.780
Now our idea of collapsing the water

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.900
Our C Weg fans

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.139
There's still some momo left

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.900
We were supposed to eat momo

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.380
She said there's still some momo left

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.099
I went to the kitchen

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.099
There's no momo left

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:37.299
She said there's no momo left

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.020
And sent me home

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.340
Then she was going to eat the momo

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
We were hiding the plastic underneath

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
And we were like

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Okay, fine, let's eat it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.060
But at least in a form

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.220
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.660
We don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.820
But at least we say we don't want to eat it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.259
But we don't say we don't want to eat it

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.459
Then we keep it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.060
Suji Bishan

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.299
Yeah

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.660
But then we'll think about it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.660
So maybe like

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.459
Maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow and put it there

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.059
We don't even have a fucking problem

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:30.660
No, but the thing is to inform them

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.260
Yeah, but what I'm saying is like

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
It is a good conversation

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.660
And I would know that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.660
I think that's a good thing

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.660
No, no, no, no

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660
It's like you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
You know

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
But I mean also

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.660
You know, like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
They have a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660
They have a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
They have a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
They have a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.660
They have a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.660
They have a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.660
They have a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.660
They have a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.660
They have a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.660
They have a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
They have a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
They have a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
Yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.660
I think

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
You should see

They'll put way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660
Right

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660
So

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
Like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660
So that we can
