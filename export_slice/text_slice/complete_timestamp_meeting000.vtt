WEBVTT

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:18.919
So hi, good morning everyone, welcome to our regular weekly meeting, so I would like to

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:25.919
start with the expansion program, in the expansion program, if you can come there,

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:32.919
I have to update, in the expansion program, Dr. Yandeck class is in class 11th Jan, and

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:46.919
the next class is in class 18th Jan, this is done by Yambu, in the next class, 18th is

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:53.919
done by Yambu, and for this workshop, date and content has to be finalized and mentioned,

00:01:53.919 --> 00:02:11.919
so WIATS IT classes is in class 11th Jan, and in class 18th Jan, WIATS IT classes, WIATS

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:49.919
IT classes, so we can't have a class with this board member, because it's not necessary

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:57.919
that everyone has to attend the meeting, so there can be some board members who will be

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.919
watching this meeting after 2-3 weeks, but we know that Dany will reply all the time,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:13.919
so if he replies, we can assume that he is watching every meeting, but some board members

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:25.919
don't watch it often, so we try to update him in this manner, so for example, if I have

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:43.919
to come to a question here, like wlpclasses.com, wlpclasses.com, we never know which board

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:49.919
member will come to the meeting, because I am just out of my way, so once in a while,

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:59.919
we try to write an explicit and detailed letter to Dany, just to let you know.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.919
Okay.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920
Okay.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:12.920
Yes, we have 2 different things, so let's say that we don't know anything about the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:32.920
board members, so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members, so

00:05:32.920 --> 00:06:00.920
let's say that we don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that we

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:26.920
don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:55.920
about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:25.920
so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:55.920
we don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:25.920
about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:55.919
so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that

00:08:56.919 --> 00:09:23.919
we don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:52.919
about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members,

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:59.919
so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members, so let's say that we don't

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:08.919
know anything about the board members, so let's say that we don't know anything about the

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:16.919
board members, so let's say that we don't know anything about the board members, so let's

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And at the store, we sell Nepali products like handbags, mufasas, etc.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
During festivals?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yes, during festivals.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And after that, everything is sold.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And on Christmas, they finish the products.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We don't sell almost everything, but on Christmas, we sell a lot.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, we have a lot of products to sell.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Still, there is room for discussion.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we made a list.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we share this excel sheet with them.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And if we want to include this in the excel sheet, we have to buy it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay, I didn't know that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, moving forward to the youth program.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For the youth program, we have a youth support plan.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Basically, we have a bulletin board.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We have two initial conversations with the school.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We have to communicate with the school first.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Because to have this new experience for the youth, we have to be 6th grade.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And we have been discussing about how to do the youth program.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because before, we were doing it on our own.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Which did not work efficiently at all.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And our number of students was also very low.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, what we are planning is, what I said.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's collect all the names of the students with their numbers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then let's show our presents through messages.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We can send messages on the bulletin board.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We can send messages through Staro.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We can send messages through Staro.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And then we can show our presents.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They will feel like, it's not that we are lost.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It will be more about our presents.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It will be more about our presents.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We can give them a call.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We can give them a call.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We can give them a call.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We are planning to meet at the end of March.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The end of March in Nepali.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Because in March, we will not be able to go to Thakur.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
No students are allowed to go to Thakur.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Because of the schedule.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Boarding and pre-boarding are being held.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
After March, we will not be able to go to Thakur.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Because of the schedule.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We will have to prepare for that as well.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The social week schedule?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Yes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
In the social week, we finished the third quarter.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And now we are starting our last quarter starting today.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Besides that, our health workshop was conducted on the 16th of January.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Along with distribution of hygiene pack.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And our Amix Nepal logo printed merch.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We are planning to have guest lecturers and field visits.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We will plan for that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
At least tentative.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Besides that, we will draft the curriculum and framework of 25-26.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In the social hours, we will have a placement.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Not all.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But we will have a placement.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We had a workshop on the 17th of January.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And we distributed the hygiene pack along with our logo.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
In the social hours, we will have a placement for 3 people.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Alisha and Sonu.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And Sonu will have a class on fashion design.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
People who watched yesterday said that they don't understand.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Why is that?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They only do simple designs.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And there is only one slot for morning shift.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
They don't have time for that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
They only do basic designs.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We are planning to start on 4th.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I think we should start on 5th.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
5th is for basic teaching.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
5th is for basic design.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We can't start on 5th.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We can't talk about all these designs.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I think that is what Isha said.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I said that.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I didn't say that.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I said that we should start today.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We can't leave one person's slot.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I said that.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
That is not a strict word for a woman.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
She just has to say that her parents can't afford.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
She can't say that.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I don't want to lie.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I went to another place.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I went to IFT.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It was a course for 8 months.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It was around 1 lakh rupees.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I told her that if you are getting a free course along with the sewing kit.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I told her not to take the sewing kit.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I told her to keep that.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
She started saying that there are only basic designs.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Plus, class timings are not matching.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I said that is fine.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
If you want to adjust the timings.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
She said no.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We didn't want to argue further.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I think we can still go.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
At least, to get in touch with this organization.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Just to understand.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Sonu was having a hard time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That is completely stupid.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I can't afford that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I don't want to do that.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That is stupid.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
If she can't afford it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Why is she even getting it?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Under the beneficiary of Amisher Nepal.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
That is stupid.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
It would be more of a valid thing.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
If we can go from our direction.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I know in our women's home.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
How many women are there in tailoring?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We are paying for that.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Sewing machines and everything.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They would get it for free.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We can initiate.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Even if we don't have the youth.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We can still send our women beneficiaries.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Who knows.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We will get it for free.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We will pay for it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We have one possibility.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Can we visit her?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Last time we visited.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I brought her number.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The session started from 8.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Today is the 3rd day.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We will come from 10.45 to 11.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
One month is there to take the interview.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
There are certain criteria.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
They have to come from an unprivileged background.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
They cannot afford it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
She will ask a few questions.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
She will get enrolled.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We can go today and ask.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I don't know.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
If there is one possibility.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Do they have a shop?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They sell all these things.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
They don't have a shop.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They don't have a shop.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
They don't have a physical store.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I think what can we do?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What can we do?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We can try to organize a field visit.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We discussed this last time.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
She has her own organization.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
She has a small store.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
She has her own store.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We can visit the store.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We can visit the store.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
What can we do?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
What can we do?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
For example.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
They will do a short presentation.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
At the store.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
They will do a short presentation.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
They will do a short presentation.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
They will do a short presentation.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
About our organization.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
About our motives.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
About our aims.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
About the benefits.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
About the benefits.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
more of that, and after that, maybe we can give these women such training,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then having to, I don't know if they would allow, but if they allow,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to communicate with these women, to take out maybe a few of their bags,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I don't know if that is possible.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They have their own organization.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Last time, we went to make paper bags.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But they don't make paper bags.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's only stitching.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And even though they have their own organization,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
they were not that interested.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So we took the number of the facilitator.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So there is a possibility to bring them here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then we can tell them to visit the field.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But I don't think they will agree to the presentation.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But we can bring their facilitator here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
She said she was free on Thursday and Friday.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So we can bring her here in the afternoon.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we can propose to them that we have this and that for the field visit.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Last time, we went to the grocery store.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We brought the paper bags.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They also buy from outside and bring it here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We can do that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But their other products are very good.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I told you, it was a very good opportunity for Sonu.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If she really wants to go to the presentation meeting,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
she can go to the 124th floor.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
She can sit there and do the presentation.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Or maybe, if she really wants to go,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
there might be this possibility of collaborating with them.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We will show them the polish teaching.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We will give them this offer.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We will show them the t-shirts.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We will buy the garments.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We are going to take every year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Every year, we will need this.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
One garment will need 50 of that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I don't know. I'm just saying.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
One garment will need 20-25 t-shirts.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That is still going to be benefited.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We are willing to do this.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We are also trying to give them business.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We will go to the 124th floor.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We know that this money is going to something sustainable.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's not going to a very commercialized industry.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's going to an industry which is very sustainable.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Which is working for the environment.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I mean, for the community.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
From that perspective, there can be this room.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, let's try to see.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They have an organization.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Can you give me this link?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I will just study.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm so busy with my schedule.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Because, the narrative has also come.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The narrative of Zubel has also come.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now, I have to do the narrative.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And then, now, the content of the Evern magazine.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That's it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I will share it with you.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Anyway, we can see this.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So, probably we will miss it.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Okay, we can try.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I mean, moving further with Children's Home Youth.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So, in Children's Home Youth, we have all the academic documents.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We have already visited Kathmandu.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We have visited Kathmandu.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We have registered in the college.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So, similarly, we have also registered in the Science and Economics department of the FCE.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, now, the further step is to find the classes.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So, to find the classes for Science and Economics.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Let's try to see both of these options.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
No?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And then, the other one is Ram Bahadur Nagar, which is again Raju.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So, Raju's name is Ram Bahadur Nagar.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So, Ram Bahadur Nagar's full name is Raju.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So, Ram Bahadur Nagar is a civilian.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I think, he is a part of the system.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
He is a part of the system.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I have seen a few pictures about his family.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, yeah, I think that is more or less about the program.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Okay, thank you so much, Rohitji and Spiti.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Moving forward, in the Children's Home Youth program, we have Kashmira.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We requested her to visit AMIX at least once a month.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But she is a little sick.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
She has a severe high fever.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Her mother is also sick.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So, she was not able to visit.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
In PBL 6 and 7, in our last meeting, we asked her to clear the remaining payments of Shri Krishna.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So, we asked her to come to Parents.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We kept all her records and provided her a cheque.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And for Siddharth's eye surgery, we also talked about his vacation.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So, his eye surgery was also done.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now, we have to pay the fees.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We have to pay the fees within a week.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We have also asked her to pay the medical bills.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We have asked her if there are any payments left to be made.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
We have asked her to come today for the cross-check and office records.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
PBL 6 and 7's final event was held in December.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
PBL 6 and 7's final event was held in December.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Due to budget constraints, we had to hold the event in December.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So, we had to postpone the event due to budget constraints.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Classes also started late.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Classes also started late.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And the holidays were also in between due to festivals.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So, I think that reason would be more valid then.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Otherwise, we would not have held the event.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Because I am sure they are going to ask.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And it is also for us like, we have to hold the event in December.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So, we have to postpone it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
They will be like, tell me the reason why.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Of course, they are not going to say why.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But it is better for us to explain.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It would be better to give them a valid reason why we are holding the event.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Though, like event.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Because the event that we are holding.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
We have to hold the event in December.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We have to postpone it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We have to hold the event in December.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We have to postpone it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It is going to somehow miscommunicate or mismanage the event.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So, instead, it is wiser to give them a context regarding like,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Classes started late.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And even PBL, Art and Solid Art, Public Holidays,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
A lot of things are happening.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And we are afraid that children won't be able to fulfill it on time.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
To complete the pictures on time.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So, the reason to postpone was that.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And in our winter package, there were some budgets left.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And in that, we have added a thermos and distributed it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Both PBL and EL.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Can you tell us about PBL's Dog Feast?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yes. Thank you.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Do you know the name of the school?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Do you know the name of the school?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Orlando.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Orlando School.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Do you know the name of the school?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Do you know the name of the school?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
What is the name of the school?

WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not so much about the material, it's more about the details.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In EL,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In EL, our classes are run by three people.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In this curriculum, we have justified with Ruhi ji.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She has also narrated the story.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The English assessment curriculum starts today.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So that's all from the children's program.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, rather than talking about the children's homeschool,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I don't know if it has been complicated or not.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But based on our experience, we have performed well.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So there is a mid-event.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We are discussing about the mid-event in Phase 8.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It has not been planned yet.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I have seen it in the last calendar.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, we are discussing about the classes' dramas,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the women's dramas,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
how to define women,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
how to create them through art.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, we will discuss about the mid-event.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Thank you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Thank you.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Let me talk to her.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Can you call her tomorrow?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I will talk to her.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I will talk to her.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
She is in the middle of the class.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
She is doing the narrative.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
She is doing the transcribing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, if you can call her tomorrow, I will talk to her.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Okay.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
About the CH event?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
In the CH event, I am planning to wish her a happy birthday.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Because one of the reasons I asked to do it in February was

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
definitely it is cold.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It is the right time to do it during that time.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I mean cold season.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It does not have to be in February itself.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It can be in March.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But I do not want to do it during the final.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It is very hot.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I think the ideal time that we can go to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
For me, it is ideal of rainy season.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But rainy season is still difficult in the past.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I have to travel by bus.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Or I would prefer to do it in the winter.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It is cold and the weather is nice.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But then, during summer, it is so cold.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Almost during the day, it would be in the house.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We would not be able to do it.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It is possible to do it in the morning.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So, we would not be able to do it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We would not be able to do it in the right time.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So, that is also one of the reasons for me.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Well, the board is asking me to break down the expenses

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
for both Virat Nagar and Mahindra Nagar.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
To go by bus, how much it will cost?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And then to go by plane, how much it will cost?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Now, there is a context.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Why do we want to do this?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I do not know.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
There is this possibility.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So, what I am trying to do.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Let me be clear from that aspect.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
When did I say this?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Of course, everyone is DJ.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I have to take your permission as well.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Even though I am taking care of the children's room,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
my responsibility, my job description.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But at the end, it is going to be you

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
who will be managing all these events.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I cannot go to Mahindra Nagar,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I cannot go to Virat Nagar all the time.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It will be either sweetie or then property.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Sometimes, I even have to go inside to an event.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I completely understand that back-to-back events

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
are routine.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
One after another.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And it is true.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I am not just saying this randomly.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I have to go to FUT management,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.000


00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
prepare speech speakers,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
help workshops,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and then finally create an event.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Even in the middle, I have to think of new events,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
processes and emerging models.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Even when even the…

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
not only because Patan Chillay

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I don't think there will be an event like this in the future.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
If I create an event,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
for the BH Nigam,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I have no problem of it being one.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
If something eve-ents is coming,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I think it might come as a big work.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So, I don't know.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Especially from the youth perspective,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I have thought about it.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Because if you remember,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in the past,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
when we used to organize CSE events,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
youth will be involved mostly.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Mostly youth will be involved.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Especially,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
we used to come to Viratnagar,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to Viratnagar.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Because we really wanted to nourish.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
But we used to come every time.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Not every time,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
but once in a while,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
we used to bring a few youth.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Few youth are like that.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But why not,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
in Viratnagar?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And this is also a part of exposure,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
for the youth.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And of course,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
we can take the best possible youth.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Even though we cannot offer them

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
internship here,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
there are this kind of exposures,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to help them build.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Because we cannot offer internship

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
properly for all the youth.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I do see a few promising youth,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
this batch method.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Who needs to have more opportunities.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
In terms of almost all the youth.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So they are asking me,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
why do you want to go for...

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
First of all,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
they didn't propose.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Like, maybe we should do two events.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
No?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
We didn't even go for something.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They didn't propose.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I said,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
okay, we'll try to do that.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now they are questioning me,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
why do you want to do two events?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So it's like kind of,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
they are putting me in a situation now,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
can you explain?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You said yes,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
now you explain.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Right?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And I'm willing to do that.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I'm willing to do that.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But then,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
it is also like,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I also have to get confirmation from you guys,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
will you be able to do it?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Right?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Because at the end,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
if you are going to say yes,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
then I will fight for it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Right?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And why it is good,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
why it is good to go to Mahidhar Nagar,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
why it is good to go to Virat Nagar,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
you know,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
all the different places.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Because, pardon me,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
not today.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And of course,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
having to go to

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Virat Nagar

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
or Mahidhar Nagar,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
you know,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
first thing,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it's a completely different experience.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We'll go to

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
a completely different geography.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Right?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Going to Purgo and going to Pachin,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Pachin is also like,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I wish,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
you know,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
it's completely different,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
new language,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
new culture,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
you know,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
you might have to adapt,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
you might not even understand

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
certain things,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
you know.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And that kind of experience,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you know,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
it's experience,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
definitely,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
it's not going to be easy.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Right?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
even for that,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
like,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
you might be very comfortable.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Here,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
you work for like,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
you are comfortable,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
you know,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
all the youth,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
all the children,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
everyone.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Now,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you are in a comfort zone,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
you know.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
after working for like,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
two months,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you go,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
every year is a challenge.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Right?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
this might be something that

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
might interest you,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
you know.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that perspective also,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
you know,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
you yourself,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
can give me a few reasons

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
regarding,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
you know,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
of course,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I know that,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I think,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it would be good if,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
you can say all these things,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
in my head also,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
there are certain structures,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I can realize that,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
this is something special.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Right?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
But,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
if you can,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
let me know,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
other reasons,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that is,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
why,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
every new perspective,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
this is required.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You can still,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
do that,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
you know.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
yeah,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
these are something that,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I think,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you know.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Do you want me to,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
fight for two events?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Yes,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
fine.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
let me tell you,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
if you are doing it,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
it will be divided.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It will be divided among,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
let's say,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
like,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
let's say,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
like,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
like,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
like,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
like,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
like,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
like,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
like,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
like,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
like,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
like,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
like,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
like,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
like,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
like,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
like,

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I can say that one event is for the community to take the lead, one event is for the community to take the lead, one event is for the student to take the lead, and one event is for the student to take the lead.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And you can have your own person that will support you, maybe in your case it can be Sandesh, in your case it can be, I don't know.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And also, there is Uyebani, we also have Osmo, Osmo wants to go, might want to go, I don't know, I don't know.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, we can divide somehow, though we know that we are taking few youth from Monan right, this year I guess.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
No, I was going to say that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We are taking few youth, youth from the program, youth from Monan.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How many youths are we taking?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't know, we have to take out the budget.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But anyway, let me do it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And then we come to know when we are taking, how we are going to do it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I have sent you the plane tickets for Birak Nagar by road and by plane.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It is only available for 2000-3000.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Exactly, we can do it, we are also talking about it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If it is a car, it is going to take us 2000.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
No, not for people, 2000 for a car, a good car.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And then we will have food on the road, 1000 rupees.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Then if it is for food, we will have snacks.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But if it is for flight, it is going to be somewhere around 35,000.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
While plane is 5000-5000.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I have seen that it is 427,000.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I have to book you a little ahead.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If you book a little ahead, it will be fine.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I don't know.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I have seen that it is 5000.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But if you book three tickets at once, it will be fine.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I have seen that it is cheaper.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If you book a little ahead, it will be fine.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If you book three tickets at once, it will be fine.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yeah, in that sense, it won't be so expensive.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
For it, it will cost 2000.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But it is 20 euros.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Right?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Yeah, because that is what they were saying.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
20 euros.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yeah, like 20 euros.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
20 euros for it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But they were willing to do it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I will share with you.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
You have to share the remaining items and update.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I will keep the above information.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And the rest of the details.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, as we are doing that,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I decided that we need to book.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I knew we need to book.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It is always good.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But, I am sorry.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But, the thing is,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the thing is,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the thing is,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
the thing is,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the thing is,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the thing is,

the thing is,

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Because he sent me a slip with the account number and the balance sheet I got.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I mapped that account number.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So there is a confusion that we deposited the money in the same account number.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We deposited the money in the same account number.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So that is the confusion.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You said that you have 5,000 rupees.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Did you know about it?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I don't know about it. I just came to this question.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So in brief please.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:52.680
Thank you so much.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Do you understand?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Yes, I understand.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In November?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And in December,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in November and December,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
was it in Jan?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Because I checked the calendar,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it was in mid of Jan.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And it should be in December,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but it was in Jan.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Didi told me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And we started from mid,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we started from last.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So, it was in Jan?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
No, it was in Feb.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Feb?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
No, it was in December.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Oh, in December.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Thank you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And in October,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we started from mid.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And in October,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we started from mid.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But it was not in Dussehra,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it was in Bida.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Thank you.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In the new strategy,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
our field visit,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and guest speakers'

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
template, as you said,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
if you could send it again,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that would be great.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In the guest speakers' template,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
as you said,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that was for the internal report,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as you said,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we are talking about the template.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And in the new strategy,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this template,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I am trying to make

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I am trying to make

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
every character

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We have tried

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
earlier changes

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we can just

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
copy and paste it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It is not a master sheet.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If we see

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the event,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the proposal,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the date,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it is in the description.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It can include

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the event,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the content,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
everything is there.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Once you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
look into it,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
everyone knows

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the event.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The event is yet to come.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Everyone knows.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
When the checklist is made,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
everything is there.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We are told to do that.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But we won't do that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But we won't do that.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It is easier.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But we won't do that.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It is easier.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
What about curriculum development

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and classes implementation?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
We are supposed to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
share our plan

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and framework

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
along with activities

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
for 2025.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
In this case,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
we have compiled

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
all the workshops

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and came up with

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the plan.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We have planned to share it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
while we are still working on it.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You can share the documents.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You can be in the account all the time.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I want us to see

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the overview.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You have to be answerable.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
You have to be lenient.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Just have a glance of it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
There are no updates

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in collaboration and intern.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We have shared the staff

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
children program coordinator

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and youth program coordinator's

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
appraisal sheet.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The appraisal sheet

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
will be available in March.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
You can check it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It is not scheduled yet.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It is not scheduled yet.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I saw the appraisal sheet

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and took it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I have a deadline.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I also have to make a

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
timeline for staff appraisal

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and other logistical

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
dynamics.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Kritam will give

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the address of accounting

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and finance.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I am waiting for the photo.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You can reply

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You can reply

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you don't

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
understand.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You can

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
understand.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
That's all I can show you.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Thank you.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Okay.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Yeah.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We don't know.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We might have to do likely

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
hopefully

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Yeah.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Okay.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Six.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
You know.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You know.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You know.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You have to pay

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
What are the other ways to

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.000


00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
What are the other ways to not escape the tax?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Hopefully I'm out of

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.000


00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Hopefully I'm out of accounting.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If you want to be

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
You know, if you want to

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
You know, if you want to conduct a thorough

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
conduct a thorough

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
If you want to check and

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If you want to check and balance

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Okay.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Alright.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I have

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I have

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I have

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I have

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I have

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I have

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I have

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You have to take many pitfalls.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I don't have a fixed place to work right now, so I'm like moving here and there.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I mean, of course, that computer, when you actually come home super late, it's super slow.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It takes forever.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not working at all.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So maybe, I don't know.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'll talk with Kabir Aman regarding this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm not expecting a high-end, high-spec computer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's just a basic computer that would be good enough for me to work at.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Do you have any other expectations?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
No, I don't.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Potential?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Potential, yeah.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Regarding admin, we have Ana Martinez.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Ana Martinez is available for volunteers for at least 2-3 months.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Patricia is actually the one who is managing all the volunteers from Spain.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So, if in case, just to let you know, if someone volunteers for you, I want to work with you.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We'll have that very random walk-in.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So once in a blue moon, I think.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I don't know anyone, I don't know anyone.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But if I look on the internet, I'll see that there's someone here.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So I'll go and meet them.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I'll do a random walk-in.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There are foreigners too, right?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And they will say, I want to volunteer.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you're a procedure, they might come to you, you know?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That can also happen.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So for that, Patricia is actually the one.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Patricia is our website.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
On our website, there's a section called Volunteers.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I think each volunteer needs to pay a certain amount to volunteer.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think it's 60 Euros or something like that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I think 60 Euros will cover their health insurance during the time they are in Nepal.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So you should always ask if there is any volunteer who just randomly walks in and wants to volunteer.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Then you should direct them to go to the website.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
On the website, there is a section called Volunteers.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And there, you are supposed to send your CV, cover letters to Patricia.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Patricia will review that and get back to you.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
While we can have random volunteers, of course, we can give them a tour around how the project works.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because it's always a possible way for us to generate money to give them.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Because sometimes, anything can happen.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
They just randomly want to walk in and they just randomly want to give money.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This also happens.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
They just randomly want to walk in and we explain the project to them.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And then they make a donation.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
This also happened in the past.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So these are our activities.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So do not reach each other and explain the projects.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So furthermore, Anna and Gauri, they are really, really great.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
They are a lot of people.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So they will hopefully be coming.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
After that, for fundraising, donor justification and reporting, we will be preparing justification.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I have updated all the activity lists.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And one thing I recently shared that I would like to be filled.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So I will be working on that.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And when the time comes, I would like to share it with you.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Just so that you can overview and see what possibilities we have.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Please, you can proceed further now.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
For communication, the first draft...

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
What was it?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Rohit?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Did he say it?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I don't know.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
For communication, I will have the first draft.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I am supposed to share it by 25th of January, which is this Friday.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I don't know how possible it is.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Because today is already Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Oh, okay.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Anyway, I am trying my best to pull it off.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Of course, I will also get back to the CPE coordinator and the YP coordinator.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Of course, there are certain things I will do by myself.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But I might need a list of newly updated list of things to share with you.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, I might ask you about it.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Ah, okay.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And one thing...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
One thing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Okay.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So...

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It should always be...

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
My point is...

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
If I had gone to EU, family is the reason why.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But I think they will say...

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I had to make a call.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, that's not a problem.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
What I feel is...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
They are coming and meeting me all the time.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I am walking here.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
There is a random visitor.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So, that was kind of frustrating.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Anyway...

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Webcam...

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Earphones...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
One of the reason was...

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
To face time with...

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Which is not happening.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And they were doing their racket.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We had...

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I will be able to do this.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I will be able to do this.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I will be able to do this.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I will be able to do this.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So, what I would say is...

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It is necessary for you.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It is not necessary for you.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You can unlock that.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
At least, if you want to unlock that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
You can keep it on the side.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Now, then you will have to...

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Only for teaching, if you want that earphone...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
If you want your student to use that earphone...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Ask them to...

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Come and say, it will be done by you.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Because you will be in that room.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And if you don't like it...

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Ask them.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
If you don't like it, don't take it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But then...

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Make sure that they are going to give them back...

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
This earphone to him.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
After using it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And not leave it there.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Because they could answer...

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Oh yeah, at least...

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
No, people are not watching so much YouTube.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Because they don't have any other options.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Not only doing other things.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You'll make your son watch this.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We have strictly asked CPQA students...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We are not providing these earphones.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We have asked them to ask us...

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
...or directly ask Mr. Kirtan or Mr. Rojan.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We have stopped this.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
If they want to ask for earphones...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
...we have researched and asked 3 people...

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
...me, Rohit, Mr. Rojan, Alisha, Navidehi, Sandeep...

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
...and we have checked and cross-checked...

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
...and we have only said that it is not okay to ask for earphones.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Oh! I didn't say external communication.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
It says we need to mail this...

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
..and we have also divided work...

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Who will review and...

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
...who will review the EC program.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
For internal reports, Rohit will share a new template.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
For monthly reports, I will create a new template...

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
..and I will also share with you the proposal that we have prepared...

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
..for 1,100 communities.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
On the basis of that proposal, we will create monthly reports.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I am also looking for certain changes...

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
..for your financing in the month of June.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
the report, so that under the solution of workloads,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.880
because we are all planning,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.680
at least the activity is the room,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.400
then it might be time-consuming

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.560
to go through all the sections,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.000
so I'd like to make it a little bit further,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.400
and that's some communication happening.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.040
Programming will be done on important update

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.639
for the company in the section that we need,

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:23.959
which won't be published in the end of the time,

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:26.320
so that the update doesn't end on how long it can be,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.559
but we have to create that in the end of the time.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.320
So, let's start doing that,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.360
while I'll give you a template of the learning,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.400
where I can prepare, create it,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.599
maybe from the new program,

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:37.720
whatever I want to,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.560
maybe not to go,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.799
but I will do that,

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:40.639
and actually,

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:42.520
I'll publish my own technique,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.360
but of course,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.200
I need to update one of them,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.520
because I don't know what the solution might be,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.400
because no only program will be taken,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.680
there will be nothing,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.520
except none,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.360
I mean,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.200
no?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.040
So,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.880
Also,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
your extra communication,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.959
Google will give you one of them,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.800
just to get it up,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.639
monthly report,

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:08.080
only two months,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.919
alternative ways,

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:09.760
I'll tell you,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.599
what I like with you,

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:11.440
last meeting,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.279
but,

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:13.120
it's end of it,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.959
just maybe,

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:14.800
it won't just be cool,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.639
and this particular,

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:16.480
in March,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.320
but it's a bit,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.160
we need to learn,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.279
so that's all for today's meeting.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.160
Yeah,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.400
just to add one part to Rosan's definition,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.239
Rosan,

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.279
I want you to create,

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.279
a big chart,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.239
I don't know,

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.080
make a chart,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.919
I don't know,

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:35.760
a big chart,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.839
but in its size,

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:37.839
or whatever,

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.040
maybe in Illustrator,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.239
or whatever,

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:42.879
so what I want to do is,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.080
do a video,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.919
yearly calendar,

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:45.760
Sunny,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.599
yearly calendar,

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.440
okay?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.080
Yearly calendar.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.919
So,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.199
so let's try to paste it here,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.039
in this board,

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.360
because we are not using this board,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.800
anyway,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.639
no, I mean,

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.479
it's not being used,

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.679
so effectively,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.720
this,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.559
on,

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:20.399
when you do it on the internet,

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.240
I'm not sure how to say that,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.080
this is very old,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.919
and watch,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.440
paper,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.279
paper,

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.119
so,

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.960
so,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.800
so,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.639
so,

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.479
so,

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.320
so,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.160
so,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.000
so,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.839
so,

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:43.679
so,

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:44.520
so,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.360
so,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.199
so,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.039
so,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.960
so,

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.559
calendar,

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:51.479
calendar,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.080
same for the report,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.679
based on the budget,

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.720
budget of the data that,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.559
there is a,

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:16.520
and it based on,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.600
calendar,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.519
I don't know if we are using them anymore.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.519
There was an email thread.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:24.519
Oh, that thread.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.519
We don't use that thread anymore.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.519
But now, what we are trying to do is to run a template.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.519
What we are trying to do is,

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.519
after running the template,

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:38.519
we will know,

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.519
sometimes it happens,

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.519
sometimes it doesn't.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:43.519
We will guess what the potential is.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:49.519
We want to see what makes a video in the endcounter easier difficulty.

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.519
Thank you very much.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:57.519
We can continue to compete in the next upload.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:01.519
We are still developing the code.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:06.519
I am still learning the code.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.519
Of course, this is a challenge for us.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:14.519
Last time, we were worried about the content quality.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:17.519
We are still developing the code.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:22.519
We are still learning the code.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.519
We are still developing the code.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.519
We are still learning the code.

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.519
We will continue to develop the code.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:35.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:38.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:48.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:06:16.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:19.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:39.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:07:04.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:27.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:52.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:08:07.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:27.519
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:47.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:09:07.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:17.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:27.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:52.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.520
I will talk with J&J or SoSigar.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
3 months but make sure you are not using it for that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for until 3 months

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
accumulating

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
if you are accumulating for 3 months

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
there is a market here

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
everyone is accumulating

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
if you are accumulating for 3 months

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you will be like oh yeah

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
what will happen?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so you accumulate every month

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but you keep it in a safe place

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
right?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and in 3 months

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if you are using other apps

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
other apps like

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
30

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
income of 30,000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
right?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in other apps

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and you are using it as a credit account

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or if you want to deposit in the account

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and you can show your proper account

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you can always do it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you can do the deposit

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
yeah

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you can deposit

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but you can't do it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you can't do it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you can't do it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
if you are from Nepal

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you can't do it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you can always deposit

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so if you are accumulating for 3 months

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
after 3 months

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you will be like

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
after 3 months

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if you are accumulating for 3 months

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but you are accumulating every month

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
right?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you can do it every month

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
if you want bank based

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you can do that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
right?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
cash flow is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in US

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
right?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
let's say

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
cash flow

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
our

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we saw cash flow in many banks

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
right?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but we didn't see cash flow in banks

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because collection wasn't good

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
right?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so that system

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that system is used here

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
right?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we can show that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so that

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it will be easy

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it will be clear

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because now

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when we are operating

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we can check

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
what we have done

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we don't have to check

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we can do it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so this basic cash flow

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
if you do it

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it will come

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
if you want

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
3 months

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
right?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you can do it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and it will come

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
from the same bank

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
right?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
so

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
every

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
every

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
every

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
every

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
way

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but it is clear

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
still

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
problem

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that is also

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
not

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
clear

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in

in

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000

WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I told him to eat the momo

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I went to the kitchen

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and asked if he had momo left

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and he said he didn't have it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so I sent it to him

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then he left

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
He was hiding the plastic

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I was like

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
ok fine, I'll give it to him

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but at least inform him

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
don't tell him not to eat it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but at least tell him

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but tell him it's not enough

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and keep it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and keep it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I told him

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I have some left

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll give you some

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't feel bad

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I don't feel bad

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't mind

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll give you some

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but I can't eat it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm not that kind of person

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're hungry and we'll eat it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but then we'll think about it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
maybe I'll eat today

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We don't want to inform

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
No, but the thing is to inform

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but one of the things

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is like

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
everyone

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
has their own way

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
if you don't know

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
how to do it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it's not worth it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll give it to him

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and he'll eat it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll give it to him

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
when you do

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
they put

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
way much more

they're not doing it in a sense

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
they make a lot

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we don't have to eat it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
why there is so much

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
expense

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it wasn't enough

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
don't tell him not to eat it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but at least tell him

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but tell him it's not enough

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and keep it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000

I'm not that kind of person

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're hungry and we'll eat it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
maybe I'll eat today

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000

but at least inform him

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
don't tell him not to eat it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but at least tell him

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but tell him it's not enough

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and keep it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and keep it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I told him

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I have some left

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll give you some

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't feel bad

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I don't feel bad

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't mind

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll give you some

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but I can't eat it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm not that kind of person

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're hungry and we'll eat it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but then we'll think about it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
maybe I'll eat today

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We don't want to inform

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
No, but the thing is to inform

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but one of the things

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is like

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
everyone

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
has their own way

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
if you don't know

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
how to do it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it's not worth it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll give it to him

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and he'll eat it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll give it to him

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and he'll eat it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Sometimes you have to eat

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Sometimes you have to eat

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but usually

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
when you do

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
they put

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
way much more

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
right

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
they put way much more

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
right

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
they're taking it home

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but then

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
they're not doing it in a sense

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
they're not doing it in a sense

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
they make a lot

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and what do they do

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
they

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
they know

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
they make a lot

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so that we can take it home

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we don't have to eat it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we can distribute it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
we don't have to eat it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we don't have to distribute it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
they make a lot

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
especially when they're in the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
day

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
instead of making a lot

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.000


00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it comes on it's own

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
they say

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
why there is so much

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
expense

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it wasn't enough

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and we're not doing it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
thank you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
theylle

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
thank you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
thank you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
thank you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
