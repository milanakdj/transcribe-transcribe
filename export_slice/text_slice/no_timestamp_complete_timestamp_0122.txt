At the store, we sell Nepali products like hemp bags, mufas, etc.

During festivals?

Yes, during festivals.

We sell everything.

And they finish everything in Christmas.

We don't sell everything, but we finish everything in Christmas.

We go to the market to see what products we can sell.

We still have room for discussion.

We have a list of our own.

We share this exercise with them.

And we discuss what we can do to improve the exercise.

We have a long paper and we are supposed to buy it.

I didn't know that.

So, moving forward to the youth program.

For the youth program, we have a youth support class.

We have two initial conversations with the teachers and the school.

I wasn't a part of the youth program.

But does our youth student have the right to improve?

What do you think?

What did you think?

If students look at us as if we were working part time...

No, we are not working part time.

But we are not complying at all.

All the names of the students and their phone numbers are in the statement.

And then they show our presence through messages.

For example, they send us messages on Facebook.

They send us style messages.

And then they ask us to send them a message.

And then they can see our presence.

They will feel that it's not that we are lost.

We don't need to go that far.

If there is an organization, such as ISHI,

we will give them all these information.

We will give some presentations...

We will do that.

We need your end of March energy.

We must do it.

Let's do it.

Let's talk about it in Nepalese.

We must do this again for sure.

Don't feel wrong.

Because you know,

SCU has been mobilizing.

I am sure.

So before March,

we are going to do this again again again.

You can do it yourself.

Some Twitter questions?

Social Week outcome.

Means the scholarships.

In Social Week,

we finished the third quarter

and now we are starting

our last quarter starting today.

And besides that,

our health workshop

was conducted on 16th January

along with

distribution of Hygiene Pack.

And after that,

our Amics Nepal

Logo Printed Merch.

And

so now

we are planning

this Social Week

Guest Lectures and

Pill Visits

will be planned

as tentative

as possible.

And besides that,

our 25th to 26th

entire

curriculum

and framework

will be drafted.

And in Social Hours,

they are all in their

respective,

not all,

but

they will be in their

respective placements.

And in their 17th January,

we had a workshop

and they were also

distributed Hygiene Pack

along with EN's Logo Printed Merch.

So

in this Social Hours,

three people will have to

look for internship placements.

Alisha and Son will have to look for

internship placements.

And Sonu will have to look for

fashion designing classes.

For those who have watched the previous

video, it has been said that

they don't understand the meaning of

Roppa because

they only do simple designs

and there is only one slot

left for morning shift.

So we are planning to

search for that one.

So

I think

we can

proceed going further.

They don't know basic stitching.

So if they see something for

design, basic design,

you cannot talk to

all these

design and whatever thing.

I think Isha will also have to say something.

I have already said

that

she was

exacting

it.

It is a free

course for women only.

And she just had to say



of course.

Isha is

like

that

someone who

is not alive.

Because fashion designing

is very expensive.

It is a course for 8 months.

It was around

1 lakh something.

And that comes down to

very expensive.

And I told her if you are getting a free course

along with the sewing kit,

don't take the sewing kit.

You keep that.

And then

she started saying

it is just basic designs.

Plus class timings

don't match.

I told her it is fine.

If you want to adjust the timings.

She said no.

And then

I told her not to make any further argument.

We can still go.

At least to get in touch

with this

organization.

Just to understand

and show our experience.

She said

phone was having

a hard time.

Though that is completely stupid at all.

I cannot afford

to lie.

I don't want to do it.

I don't want to do that.

It is stupid.

If she can't do it,

why is she

under the beneficiary of

Angshar Nepal.

Though that is stupid.

I think

it would be more

valid thing

if we can go from

our direction.

No money.

In fact, I know

in our women's home,

how many women are there in tailoring?

Four.

Four women are tailoring.

We are paying for them.

The sewing machines and everything.

They would get it for free.

We can initiate

by showing our presence.

Even if our youth

doesn't come,

we can still send our women.

We get free

from those four women.

Those four would

send their daughters.

It is still one possibility.

I think we should go from that perspective.

Have you visited Jogpath?

Last time we visited.

I brought her number

from Asthi.

The new session

started from Asthi.

Today is 3rd day of 4th day.

From 10.45pm

to 11.00pm

because one man is there

to take the interview.

There would be certain criteria.

They have to come from

unprivileged family background

who cannot really afford.

Few questions

would be asked.

We can go today

and ask these people.

I don't know

if there is one possibility.

Do they have

a shop where women

can sell

all these things?

No.

They don't have a physical store.

I think what can we do?

For our youth,

what if we can try

to organize a field visit?

Jogpath is

its own organization.

Their stores are

very small.

Field visit,

we can do that.

We will take the youth

and see what they can do.

What kind of field visit

can we do?

For example,

I will assume,

they will do a short presentation

not on this topic.

They can do it in the store

or factory.

It is not possible.

They do a short presentation

about how they

are sustaining.

What are their needs?

What are their main motives?

We can organize

a field visit.

We can organize

a field visit.


more of that, more of that, and then having to, I don't know if they would allow, but

then if allowed, to communicate with this woman, to take out maybe a few of their bibles,

I don't know if that is possible.

We have our own organization.

Last time we went to make these paper bags, but they didn't make the paper bags.

It was only stitching.

And even though they have their own organization, they were not that interested.

So we, the facilitator, he had brought a number, so there is a possibility of bringing him here.

He can visit the field, but I don't think he will accept the presentation.

But he can bring his facilitator here and do it.

She said she was free on Thursday, Friday, something like that.

So he can bring her here on that day, and he can propose to her that he is interested

in the Moroo field visit.

Last time we were there in the town.

Roshan?

Yes.

So he can buy from outside and bring her here.

We have our own organization.

Yes.

But his products are very good.

The bags.

Yes.

I told you, it was a very good opportunity for Sonu.

If she really wants to do it, then we can do it.

Or maybe, if she really wants to do it, there might be this possibility of collaborating

with them, polish stitching, and we show you.

We give them this offer.

We show you the t-shirts.

You buy the bags.

We are going to take every year.

Every year, we meet this.

One garment, maybe 50 of that.

I don't know.

Let's see.

Maybe not.

One garment, maybe 20 pieces.

So that is still going to be benefited.

Who knows, we are willing to do this.

We are also trying to give them business.

We know that this money is going to something sustainable.

It's not going to a very commercialized industry.

It is going to an industry which is very sustainable, which is working for the environment.

For the community.

Maybe, there can be this room.

Let's try to see.

We can collaborate in a lot of ways.

They are an organization.

Can you give me this link?

I will just study it.

I am so busy with my schedule.

Because the narrative has come.

Now, I have to do the narrative.

And now, the content of the magazine.

I have shared it with you.

We can see this.

We can try.

One photo with you.

So,

For the time being, let's try to do both of these options.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Again, Raju.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Ram Bahadur Moghul.

Thank you so much.

Moving forward.

We have a lot of payment bills.

We have to pay them.

We have to pay for the cross-check.

And for the office record.

We have to pay.

PBL 6 and 7.

Our final event.

In January.

In December.

We had a meeting in January.

29th.

6th and 23rd.

This is back to back.

I'm sure they're going to ask.

It's also for us.

December.

December.

Why?

Of course, they're not going to say why.

It's better for us to explain.

It would be better to give them a valid reason.

Event.

Event.

Event.

It is going to somehow.

Miscommunication.

Mismanagement.

Instead, it is.

Wiser.

To give them a context.

Regarding.

No.

Even.

The art.

And solidarity.

We are afraid.

That children will not be able to.

It will happen.

It will happen.

It will happen.

It will happen.

It will happen.

Cheremos.



Chambers.

Chambers.

So,

the

audience.

The

organization.

The

organization.

The

organization.

Do your own

name of the

school.

Language

school.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.


So that's all from the children's program.

So children's homes...

Just to let you know, I don't know if it has been communicated to you, right?

Yes, it has been communicated to us.

So we are very happy to have you here.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

It has been communicated.

But for experiential learning, we are doing a mid-event.

So there is a mid-event happening in a few days.

For the mid-event, we were discussing what we would do for Phase 8.

But we had not planned it, so I had not watched it.

It was in the calendar.

Now, we are going to have a class discussion.

We will discuss how to define women, how to create art.

For the mid-event, we will all sit together and discuss.

.

.

Let me talk about it.

.

For the CH event, we are planning to reschedule it for February.

.

In the cold season, it does not have to be February.

It can be in March, but I do not want to go.

.

For me, it is either in the rainy season.

In the rainy season, it is difficult to make it.

.

It is cold and the weather is nice.

In the summer, it is so cold.

.

We will not be able to do it.

.

We will not be able to do it in the right time.

.

The board is asking me to break down the expenses.

.

.

I can say it happens. One event is for Spiti to take lead. One event will be for Proximity to take lead. One event will be for Julian to take lead.

And one event, Rozen can take lead.

And you can have your own person that will support you. Maybe in your case it can be Sandvich.

In your case it can be, I don't know.

And also there is Uyebani. It can be Asu. Asu wants to go. Mike wants to go too.

So we can divide them. Though we know that we are taking a few youths to Manang.

Yes.

I was going to say that.

We are taking a few youths.

We are taking a few youths from the program to Manang.

There is a program called B90.

It is a new event.

It is a new event for me.

It is an old event.

How many youths are we taking?

I don't know. We have to check out the budget.

Okay.

But anyway, let me do it.

Let's insist on two.

And then we can think of where we are taking them.

I have sent you the plans for Birak Nagar by road and by plane.

It is a decision made in 2000-3000.

Exactly. We are also talking about it.

If it is done by car, it is going to take us 2000.

Not going, but 2000 in a good car.

If it is done by car, it is going to take us 2000.

If it is done by road, it is going to take us 1000.

If it is done by car, it is going to take us 1000.

If it is done by flight, it is going to take us 1000.

It is going to be somewhere around 35,000.

While the plane is 5000.

I saw that it is going to be 4000-3000.

James, I told you to book a little earlier.

If you book a little earlier, it is going to be cheaper.

But even if you do three at a time, it is going to be cheaper.

So, if you do it a little earlier, it is going to be cheaper.

Yeah, in that sense, it won't be so expensive.

For it, it is going to be 2000.

But it is going to be 20 euros.

Right?

Yes.

Because that is what they were saying.

20 euros.

Yes.

20 euros.

It is going to be 20 euros.

So, they were meaning to do it.

I am going to share the rest of the items with you.

I am going to add more.

I am going to add the end page.

I am going to add the rest of the links.

Okay.

So, as we are doing that.

It is the end of the meeting.

Are you leaving?

Yes.

Yes, I am leaving.

You can meet me again.

No, I am leaving.

It is a public meeting.

It is a public meeting.

No, I am leaving.

No, I am leaving.

No, I am leaving.

Yes, I am leaving.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

Okay.

Goodbye.

I will be leaving now.

Goodbye.

I will be leaving now.

In November and December was the final event. Was it in Jan?

Because when I checked the calendar, it was in mid-Jan.

And we were supposed to get married in Jan, not in December.

And we got married at the end of mid-Jan.

It was supposed to be in Jan.

It was supposed to be in December.

But we were supposed to get married in October.

So I was a bit anxious.

But it was supposed to be in October.

But it was supposed to be in December.

In the new strategy, you mentioned the field visit and the template of the guest speakers.

Can you tell us about that?

You mentioned the template of the guest speakers for the internal report.

What about the template of the new strategy?

I am trying to make a checklist for every calendar.

We have tried a little bit in the copy and paste.

In the copy and paste, there is a master sheet.

If we see which events took place, what is the data,

everything is described in the master sheet.

You can see the field visit, the final event, and the content.

Once you look into it, you will know which events took place.

You can also see which events are yet to take place.

We have only seen the events that have already taken place.

What about the curriculum, development, and classes implementation?

We are supposed to share our plan and framework.

It is already activated for 2025.

In this, we have compiled the guest speakers' field visits and the final event workshops.

We are planning to share this with our registered clients.

I want you to share the documents so that you can be in the account all the time.

I want us to see the overview.

You have to be answerable to your staff.

We are being lenient in the sense that we are meeting with our staff.

Just have a go and talk to them.

As CP said, we will be working on the English curriculum from today.

There are no updates in collaboration and intern.

For the staff, the children program coordinator and youth program coordinator

have already shared the operational sheet with us.

Operational sheet?

I am not sure.

I am not sure.

I saw the sheet and I saw that there is no date.

I saw that and I saw that there is no date.

I also have to take a timeline.

I have to take a timeline for the operational and other logistics.

Okay.

After this, we will update the accounting and auditing.

Finance book.

I think I have to wait.

CP done.

CP done.

CP done.

CP done.

Okay.

CP done.

CP done.

CP done.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

So,

I'm

I'm

I'm

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right.

I get a new laptop.

Yeah.


I don't have a fixed place to work right now, so I'm like moving in and yeah, I mean,

I'm not expecting a high-end high-speed computer, it's just a basic computer.

So, regarding admin, I think Ana Martinez is available for volunteer for 2-3-1.

So Patricia is actually the one who is managing it.

So, all the volunteers from this side.

So, if in case, just to let you know, I want to volunteer.

We'll have that very random walk-in for foreigners.

So, once in a blue moon, I think.

And if they would say, I want to volunteer, give you a procedure, I'm not going to lie.

They might come to you, you know.

Patricia is actually the one.

Patricia is a volunteer from our website.

And I think each volunteer needs to pay a certain amount to volunteer.

June 16th, I think, June 16th, we'll cover health insurance during that time.

You should always ask if there is any volunteer.

If there is a volunteer who just randomly walks in, I mean, wants to volunteer, then you should direct them to go to the website.

And you will check the section called volunteer.

And there you are supposed to send your CV, cover letter to Patricia, and Patricia will review that.

Of course, you can give them a call, you know.

If all of the folks in UEFA ask to generate money to get on it.

Because sometimes, they just randomly want to walk in, and they just randomly want to give money.

That also happens.

They just randomly want to walk in.

And we expect them to do the same program.

And then they...

They can plan the projects.

So, for the more aligned logic, they are...

They can plan the projects.

And then you have to prepare for the fundraising, donor registration, and reporting.

So, I have updated all the activity lists.

And the monthly revisions we shared that have to be filled.

So, I'll be working on that.

And I'll be covering some of the other activities as well.

Just so that you know.

By 25th of January, which is this Friday.

I don't know how possible it is.

Because today is already Tuesday.

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

You see the resolution, but it's hard.

Anyway, I'm trying my best to pull it off.

Of course, I'll also get back to...

Hello, hello?

Hello.

Hello.

Hi.

Hello.

Yes.

Yes.

My name is...

My name is...

My name is Rajesh.

It's been a while since I've seen you.

Yes.

My name is...

My name is Rajesh.

It's been a while since I've seen you.

Yes.

It's been a while since I've seen you.

Yes.

Yes.

And I just want to say that I am...

That I am a millionaire.

My point is...

What I feel is that the exchange of...

I feel is that the exchange of...

I feel is that the exchange of...

So, I would...

So, we have strictly told CPQA students.

We are not providing them an earphones, either.

Last year.

It's been 6 years.

We ask that they stop asking for basic things way beyond what they need

So, we have stopped giving them basic things.

If they need to ask for earphones, we do a research and

we check in 3 places.

I, Rohit, Rujanji, Alisha, Navidehi, Sonbish, Time.

We cross-check and decide if it is okay to give them or not.

That's what we are doing right now.

And I will not tell you about external communication.

In this, we...

In External Communication, first we do...

We keep mailing AZM mails to sign up,

and the emails that we would like would have been stopped before.

In this, we also divide up work.

We have divided up every person's review,

And anyone's plans,

And even reviewing EC for any program,

we have already solved all of this in Canvas.

So, for any internal reports,

Rohitji will share these templates.

So, is that fine?

So, once the report is collected,

I will create it.


Let's start doing that more.

Because, I told you, you know,

what Russell Mishelman said,

he was, you know,

what are the programs that they can develop?

Excellent, no?

So, that's all for today's meeting.

Yeah, I mean, just to add to one of the parts of the presentation.

I want to create a chart,

I don't know, make a chart,

I don't know, make a chart,

make it in Illustrator or whatever.

So, what I want to do is,

Early calendar, sir.

Early calendar, no?

I'll tell you.

Oops.

Excuse me.

So, let's try to paste it here in this way,

because we are using this way.

Okay.

Very old.

Paper.

Calendar.

So,

What was it?

And it based on your plan.

So,

I mean,

we are planning to create one video.

I mean,

I don't know if we are using it anymore.

Email thread.

Okay.

Okay.

So,

if you say that,

If you are coming for 15 days,

Let's assume,

If you are coming for 15 days,

You can pay 1500.

Right?

Or let's say,

If you are coming only for 10 days,

Let's pay 1000.

Right?

So, if you are coming for 15 days,

Pay 1500.

But if you are coming for 11 days,

Pay 2000.

If you are coming for 16 days,

Pay 2000.

Okay?

Okay.

Okay.

Let's do.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

So,

Okay.

Okay.


But make sure you are not using it for that, for until 3 months.

We say that 3 months is too long.

Here in Bajaj, everyone is using WhatsApp.

If you are using it for 3 months, then it's okay.

So, you can use it every month, but you keep it in a safe place.

And in 3 months, you can use it for other apps.

For example, you can use it for 30 houses.

You can use it for other apps.

And until then, you are using it for 30 apps.

Or if you want to deposit it in your account, you can use it.

You can use it.

If you want to deposit it, you can use it.

Here, you can deposit it.

Or you can keep it in a safe place.

You can keep it in a safe place.

You can always use it.

If you are in a bank, it is okay to keep it in a safe place.

So, keep it in a safe place.

And don't show it to anyone.

You can even keep it in a safe place.

If you want to keep it, you can use it.

You can keep it in a safe place.

So, keep it in a safe place.

And don't show it to anyone.

Keep it in a safe place.

Keep it in a safe place.

Do you want to say anything to anyone?

Is there anything else?

I was so pissed off with one Sam Thani guy.

He had a very long training.

And every day he used to send me a message.

It was not as a joke.

But he said he was frustrated with me.

And I gave him the card.

And he did a small thing for me.

He used to do this and that.

And I used to call him.

And I used to call him with my phone.

And I used to call him with my phone.

And he did it instantly.

No, it's so frustrating.

It's not like that with women.

They don't let their wives talk to them.

And sometimes they don't talk to me.

Of course, I was frustrated.

Sometimes, he was not willing to talk to me.

I was also like that.

So yeah, no, I do think about it.

Yeah, I mean, imagine how many family members do you have?

Pardon?

How many family members do you have?

Five.

If you don't want to say.

No, no, I'm fine.

So five people, how much do you spend in a month?

I don't know, I'm so sorry.

Because we have paid them 15 rupees.

15 rupees we have paid them.

It's a little bit too much.

Yeah.

So I mean, it's a little bit too much.

It's a little bit too much.

It's a little bit too much.

I don't know why it's a little bit too much.

Yeah.

And then we have found literally, literally we have found them making us leave.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Sorry.

Be cautious.

Be cautious.

I don't mean like do not trust them.

Be cautious of their actions around you.

That would be the message.

Especially the chicken momos.

I don't remember why they were giving me chicken.

It came in a big size.

It was not distributed to me one by one.

I can talk to them about this.

It should come under my review.

It should come under my review.

Thank you for watching.


You cannot lure the customer with the art of coloring

Instead, it is a scheduled activity

A kind of method to engage people

Oh! there's that

Toria

That's exactly what we were about to say

There's no momo left

She said there's no momo left

And sent me home

Then she was going to eat the momo

We were hiding the plastic underneath

And we were like

Okay, fine, let's eat it

But at least in a form

We don't say we don't want to eat it

We don't say we don't want to eat it

But at least we say we don't want to eat it

But we don't say we don't want to eat it

Then we keep it

Suji Bishan

Yeah

But then we'll think about it

So maybe like

Maybe I'll bring one packet tomorrow and put it there

We don't even have a fucking problem

No, but the thing is to inform them

Yeah, but what I'm saying is like

It is a good conversation

And I would know that
